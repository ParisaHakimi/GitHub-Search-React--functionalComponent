# GitHub search is a responsive react app using GitHub API that finds any GitHub users.

Icons are utilized from `Fontawesome` and mostly styled and gridded by `BootStrap`.
Organized components and routers in modern React fashion.
By searching a name and pushing the search button; all GitHub users with the same name will show up then the input will get empty. The goal was to use State and bind the form's input to it and show the `API` and `Axios` usage.
By clicking on each user, it'll go to the user page and show their info on GitHub like their bio section, repositories, etc. `The loader` will appear till all data get uploaded.
